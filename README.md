# Deception Detection Questionnaire

This project is a web-based questionnaire designed to detect deception based on user behavior, specifically analyzing mouse movements, hesitation, pauses, and jerk spikes while answering questions. It includes a front-end interface for the user to interact with, a back-end server for handling data, and machine learning models for analyzing responses and detecting potential deception.

## Usage
Starting server and navigation to http://localhost:3000.

The questionnaire will guide the user through two parts: answering truthfully in the first part and then lying in the second part.

The system tracks mouse movements, pauses, and hesitation during the questionnaire to analyze potential deception.

Upon completion, the data is saved to the server, which logs the user’s session, including mouse data and responses.
